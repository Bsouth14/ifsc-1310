  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>In this assignment I ask that you collect feedback from a peer, family member, or a friend on your first attempt at the Dragon or Segway project. Using that feedback, I'd like you to attempt to address any issues or problems pointed out by your potential users. You should provide a link to the revised project (duplicate the directory in aws and then add a link to the revised project (see above). You should also provide several paragraphs reflecting on the learning experience working on this project and your experience during the semester. What were the things you did well? What would you do differently if you had to startover? Also report on the feedback you received and what you did to address those issues or why you chose not to make the recommended changes.</p>
<h2>Thughts on progrssive enchanment</h2>
<p>During this project I have learned the in and outs of a basic websites, because of the many websities that we have built up. This website has given me a lot of experience of making a website from stratch even though I did not do the best at the basics of the websites i could always clean stuff up with the next one. This has shown me that the more and more websites I make from stratch the better and better I get from making them. But even though I revsised it, there is still quiet a few things I can work on that would make the website better. Like the Q and A page is still messed up because I could not get the javascript right on it. I received quiet of bit of critisim about the Q and A page but I coud not find a way to fx it. But they also gave me other small things to work on in the future, and i tried to put this is the website and took what they said and changed it based on what they said. If I had to start over I would spend way more time in css working with it and making it look better than it does right now.  </p>
